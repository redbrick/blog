Hey, brickies!

Welcome to the 5th week of the college year! Hope you all had a lovely 
weekend. The college year seems to be speeding by with no speed limit. 
Might wanna slow it down there a bit pal.

Have you seen the Linux PCs in the labs and thought, I would love that 
on my machine? Think no more, as we will be demonstrating how to install 
Linux on your own computer in L114 on Monday the 9th of October from 
1:30-3pm. Upgrade your PC and have some pizza!

I’m sure you have been watching the F1 over the weekend and wanted to 
try racing for yourself. Now you can! Get behind the wheel as we will be 
hosting Racing AI down in L125 on Thursday the 12th of October from 
1-2pm. Pizza is included.

We just had a successful EGM last week. The constitution was updated, 
pizza was eaten and we welcomed four new committee members to the team! 
Thanks to everyone for attending and thanks to everyone who ran for a 
position!

Dennis (swooshy) - First Year Rep
Stefania (stefania) - Events Officer
Philip (payne) - PRO
Callum (browner) - Ordinary Member

Want to be able to say “I use Arch btw” to your friends. Sick and tired 
of Windows auto-updating and breaking everything? Well get ready to 
remove your windows as a new operating system will be entering your 
house, Linux! Come to L114 on Monday the 9th of October at 1:30-3pm to 
partake. Bring your laptop if you want!
