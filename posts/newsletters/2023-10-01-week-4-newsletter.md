Hey, brickies!

Happy week 4 everyone! Hope you all had a lovely weekend. It’s now 
October which means spooky season has officially begun! This week’s cat 
GIF will be you if you decide to run for one of the committee positions 
at our EGM!

The topic for this week’s Hackerclub is all about Python. So if you are 
just getting started with Python or are looking for a refresher on the 
basics, then this Hackerclub is perfect for you! Come down this week and 
level up your Python knowledge.

Happy EGM season! Our EGM is coming up this week and we have a wide 
range of committee roles that need to be filled. The following are open:

First Year Rep
Trips & Events Officer
PRO (Public Relations Officer)
Ordinary Member

If you are interested in running for any of the above, come to L125 on 
Thursday the 5th of October at 1pm and give a 30-second speech about why 
you would like the role and what you would hope to achieve if elected. 
If you are thinking about running, just do it, you won’t regret it!

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2rCnJftcxn) server to interact with fellow brickies 
and the committee.

### TL;DR:

Intro to Python: 2nd of October @ 1:30-3pm, L114
