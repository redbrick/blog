Hey, brickies!

Welcome to week 3! Hope you all had a wonderful weekend! The evenings 
are starting to get a bit brighter, although very slowly but we will get 
there! We have two events for you this week, one about Pi's and the 
other about PC's.

To kick things off this week we will be hosting Redbrick Cribs, it's 
basically MTV Cribs but more computery. You can submit your awesome pc 
setup and give a quick presentation on it and there will be prizes for 
the best setups! If you want to enter, make sure to submit your setup 
[here](https://forms.gle/fssUvvtCg8856J9x9). The battle of the setups 
will take place on Wednesday the 31st of January from 1-2pm in L114.

For our hackerclub, which follows directly after Redbrick Cribs, we will 
be walking you through everything you can do with a Raspberry Pi. If you 
already have one or are thinking of purchasing one, come along down to 
L125 on Wednesday the 31st of January from 2-4pm to learn about all the 
cool stuff you can do with it!

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://chat.redbrick.dcu.ie/) server to interact with fellow brickies 
and the committee.
