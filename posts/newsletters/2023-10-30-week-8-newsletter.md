Hey, brickies!

Happy Halloween! I hope you all are enjoying the nice long weekend. Why 
can’t every weekend be like this? Week 8 has arrived! These weeks are 
flying by and before we know it, it’ll be Christmas!

We have a nice combination of events lined up for you this week. We will 
be going bowling in Leisureplex Blanchardstown on Wednesday 1st of 
November from 6:30-9pm. The sign-up form is located [here](https://forms.gle/dAWX8Wy9LEZczWh29). If you are interested, sign up 
quickly as there is a limited number of slots available and it will be 
first come first served. Hope to see you all there!

Our Hackerclub this week will be about setting up your development 
environment, giving you tips on the best software to use for development 
and how to effectively use aliases to speed up all that typing. Sprint 
down to LG25 on Wednesday the 1st of November from 3-5pm to find out 
more, or come for the pizza, up to you :)

Redbrick will be doing its annual pilgrimage to FOSDEM which is an 
open-source tech conference taking place in Brussels, Belgium on the 3rd

make you more productive. Wondering what all the fuss about VSCode and 
VIM is? Come on down to LG25 on Wednesday the 1st of November from 3-5pm 
level up your development environment. Pizza will be provided also!
