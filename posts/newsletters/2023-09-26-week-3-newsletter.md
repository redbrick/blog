Hey, brickies!

Week 3 has begun, and it’s the first week everyone is in college 
together! It's hard to believe we are nearly a quarter of the way 
through the semester already. Time does fly!

A big welcome to all the first years who started their lectures this 
week. We hope all of you are enjoying the transition to lectures and 
college life. We have some events that will be right up your alley. From 
intros to Redbrick’s systems and services to Linux command tips and 
Einstein walkthroughs, it’s a week you don’t want to miss!

Memberships are open on the Clubs and Societies website for the new 
year. If you haven’t already signed up and paid for your Redbrick 
membership, you can click this link [here](https://dcuclubsandsocs.ie/society/redbrick). You need to be a paid 
Redbrick member to attend our events.

Want a keycard to our common room? Now’s your chance! We will be 
distributing keycards at 4PM on Wednesday the 27th of September in L125. 
We will also be doing common room tours so you can find out where it 
actually is!

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2rCnJftcxn) server to interact with fellow brickies 
and the committee.
