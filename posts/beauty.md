Hey
As computing students, we all know that the best way to do anything on a PC is via the command line (how else would people know that you're in IT?!) And as Redbrick members, you are aware that you have a free to use wetty environemnt? (wetty.redbrick.dcu.ie)
But while looking like a l33t hacker is great while you're doing God-knows-what in your terminal, sometimes that black and white window is just so... bland.

More on that later...
