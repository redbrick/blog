# Paul Bunbury - Redbrick Blog

Hi all,

As you know, one of our members went missing on the 2nd of February. Paul Bunbury, Redbrick username of “bunbun” was a third year Computer Applications student.

We are sorry to say that on the 13th of March, remains removed from the Liffey were identified as Paul’s.

We offer the sincerest condolences to the Bunbury family at this time, as well as Paul’s friends. There are many of his friends in Redbrick, and Paul was one of our greatest personalities.

We will all miss Paul sorely, and we would like to thank everyone who shared Paul’s picture and information, and those who dedicated their time to putting up posters and searching for him.

“Good-night, sweet prince; And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.”

Rest in peace Paul.
