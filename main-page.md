Why you need to lock versions The Preamble Redbrick runs a service called HackMD. It is web-based markdown editor. At the start of the year HackMD version one came out and in early February we decided to update it. Unlike most updates in Redbrick, this isn’t really a big thing as it runs inside Docker container, with its only external dependency being PostgreSQL 9.
