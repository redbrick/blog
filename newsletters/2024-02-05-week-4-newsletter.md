Hey, brickies!

Welcome to week 4! Hope you are all enjoying the nice long weekend! Love when these come around. We have another one coming soon enough also!

Thanks to everyone for entering into our Redbrick Cribs competition that we held last week. We had some amazing setups submitted and it was hard to choose the winners. In first place we had @hypnoant, in second place we had @wizzdom and in third place we had @ayden. Congratulations to all the winners!

For events this week, we have our Redbrick EGM where we will be updating the constitution and electing a new SysAdmin to the Redbrick Committee. It will be held on Wednesday the 7th of February from 2-2:30pm in L125.

Right after our new admin is chosen. We will be hosting a Hackerclub all about the world of Satellite Transmissions. If you are interested in all things radio, signal intercepting and satellite tracking, join us in L125 from 2:30-4pm on Wednesday the 7th of February.

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://chat.redbrick.dcu.ie/) server to interact with fellow brickies and the committee.

In this week's Hackerclub, we will be teaching you about how satellite signals are transmitted and how you can intercept these through radio frequencies. We will be giving video demonstrations and also will be showing you how to track satellites. Does this seem like something up your alley? Well come on down to L125 on Wednesday the 7th of February from 2:30-4pm. Pizza as usual!
