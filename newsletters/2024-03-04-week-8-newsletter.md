Hey, brickies!

Welcome to week 8! Hope you all had a nice and relaxing reading week (where no reading was done I hope). Snow is back in March again, weird that it always happens in March right?

Anyway, we have an exciting intersoc coming up and we have also launched our new website recently! Let's jump right in!

Redbrick and Airsoft are joining forces this week for an intersoc! Ever wanted to try out airsoft? Now's your chance!

Signups will be happening on Monday the 4th and Tuesday the 5th of March from 12pm-3pm in the U Building. It will cost €20 which is non-refundable.

We will be leaving from the Helix on Wednesday the 6th of March at 9am and returning at 6pm. You should bring sturdy shoes/boots, warm clothes, water and a packed lunch with you. Gloves are also recommended.

Redbrick has a new website! magma, our webmaster has been hard at work redesigning the website and it looks amazing! It features information about the committee, newsletters, blogs, open governance and more! You can check it out at [redbrick.dcu.ie](https://redbrick.dcu.ie/?utm_source=newsletter)

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.redbrick.dcu.ie/) server to interact with fellow brickies and the committee.
