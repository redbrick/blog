![Week 11 Newsletter](https://i.imgur.com/s1UmcLX.gif)



Hey, brickies!

Welcome to week 11! Can't believe it's already time to write the last newsletter of this year's committee. Hope you all enjoyed my cat GIFs throughout the year! Had a great time writing the emails!

We're switching things up this week by having our events in the evening instead of the afternoon. We have both our AGM where you will get to elect and run for next year's committee and our pub quiz where you can show off your quizzing skills. Both are back to back on Wednesday the 27th of March so join us for a fun-filled night!

It's AGM time! We will be hosting our AGM this Wednesday the 27th of March from 6-7.30pm in CG86. All positions are available so if you think you have what it takes to be on the committee, come on down and run! If you are interested in running for SysAdmin, Helpdesk or Webmaster, you will have needed to pass the respective exams that were held earlier in the week or have completed them previously.

During the AGM we will be ratifying our open governance documents, please read through them in advance of the AGM as you will be asked to vote them in on the day. You can find the documents [here](https://redbrick.dcu.ie/open-governance/readme.html).

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.redbrick.dcu.ie/) server to interact with fellow brickies and the committee.

### TL;DR:

- Redbrick AGM: Wednesday the 27th of March @ 6-7.30pm, CG86
- Pub Quiz: Wednesday the 27th of March @ 7.30-9pm, Nubar
