Hey, brickies!

I hope you are all doing well. Welcome back to college, or for some of you, welcome to college for the first time! I hope everyone is settling back into college life nicely. Exams and assignments are back again, panic!

We have a lot of events planned this year, and we can’t wait to share them with you. Keep an eye on these emails throughout the college year to keep updated about all our events and activities!

Check out our new Discord server banner created by Philip (payne). It’s really cool and captures the essence of Redbrick perfectly.

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2rCnJftcxn) server to chill out with fellow brickies and the committee.
