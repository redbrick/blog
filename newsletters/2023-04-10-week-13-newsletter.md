Hey, brickies!

Hope you are enjoying the long weekend and a happy Easter to everyone!

Welcome to Week 13, the final week of this semester, where lectures are 
trying to finish course material and all anyone can talk about is the 
upcoming exams. It is truly a crazy week to be in college.

Best of luck and farewell to all of our 4th year brickies who will be 
graduating later this year. You will do great!

The GIF of the week is how I feel when people talk about exams and 
assignments, I don’t need to hear this, please. Let’s just pretend they 
don’t exist ;)

Thanks to everyone for coming to our pub quiz last week, it was a great 
night. Congratulations to all the teams that won and enjoy the many 
takeaways from those vouchers!

There are no events scheduled for this week due to lectures finishing 
up, assignments and exams. If you don’t have any exams, lucky you, I’m 
jealous ;)

On behalf of the committee, I would like to wish you the best of luck 
with all the upcoming exams and assignments, you got this! We will be 
back in September with many more interesting hackerclubs and events. 
Enjoy your summers!

Thanks for reading the final newsletter of the academic year. Don’t 
worry, I’ll return in September with many new cat GIFs for you to enjoy. 
See you around!

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2rCnJftcxn) server to chill out with fellow brickies 
and the committee.
