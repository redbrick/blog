Hey, brickies!

Welcome to week number 6 of the semester! How are we halfway through the 
semester already? This can’t be happening??? Feels like we just started 
a week ago!!

Hope you all had a lovely weekend and I hope you aren’t too devastated 
after the rugby World Cup match. This week’s cat GIF is the admins after 
fixing mail for the 100th time this week. Be nice to them.

Have you heard people talking about Git and GitHub and want to figure 
out how to use it all? Come to L114 on Monday the 16th of October from 
1:30-3pm to learn how to “git good” at all things git. There will also 
be pizza!

Are you interested in hosting your own Netflix, or want to connect to 
your home from anywhere? Are you curious as to which services and 
devices the admins run in their homes? Visit L125 on the 19th of October 
from 1-2pm to learn about the world of home servers! Pizza will be served!

Redbrick will be doing its annual pilgrimage to FOSDEM which is an 
open-source tech conference taking place in Brussels, Belgium on the 3rd 
and 4th of February 2024. You can register your interest by filling in 
this Google form [here](https://forms.gle/2ExGn2XwsjRcgKLm9).

Do you want a Redbrick hoodie? Of course you do. It’s a great way to 
show off your Redbrick membership and you can have your username on the 
sleeve. If you are interested, please fill in this Google form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQ4DqXl4cd9g7VKC5lHzODlW3udn5wAPz…). 
Deadline for hoodie forms is the 27th of October.

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2rCnJftcxn) server to interact with fellow brickies 
and the committee.
