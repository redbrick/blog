Hey, brickies!

Welcome to week 2! Hope you have all settled back into the swing of things. We have not one, not two, but three events for you this week! We will be hosting a Build a Brick event, a Hackerclub on Docker and an Admin Bootcamp. It's a busy week!


So we've got a bunch of cool events lined up for you! Keep your Wednesday free as this week it's Redbrick Wednesday!

First up, we have our Build a Brick event. This is a great opportunity to get creative and make your own Redbrick logo. Bring your trusty art supplies with you. The event will take place on Wednesday the 24th of January from 1-2pm in L114. Pizza will be provided!

After you create your bricks, there will be a Hackerclub all about Docker. We will be teaching you the basics regarding Docker and demonstrating some practical uses for it. The dockerising will take place on Wednesday the 24th of January from 2-3pm in L125. There will be Pizza!

Finally to wrap the day off we will be having an Admin Bootcamp hosted by our one and only SysAdmins! Interested in gaining an insight into how to manage all of Redbrick's servers and services? Then make your way to L125 on Wednesday the 24th of January from 3-4pm.

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://chat.redbrick.dcu.ie/) server to interact with fellow brickies and the committee.

This week's hackerclub will be all about how to use Docker. It's an essential tool if you want to dive into the world of homelabbing and is a must-know if you fancy yourself a DevOps job. Compose yourself and come down to L125 on Wednesday the 24th of January from 2-3pm. Pizza will be provided!
