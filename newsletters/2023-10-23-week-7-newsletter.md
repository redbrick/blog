Hey, brickies!

I hope you all had a lovely weekend. Welcome to the 7th week of the 
semester! While the rest of the college is sleeping and relaxing during 
reading week, we still have lectures to attend and exams to do. :(

Oh the joys of being in STEM. At least we get it next semester, you know 
what else happens next semester? FOSDEM!!! Register your interest [here](https://forms.gle/2ExGn2XwsjRcgKLm9).

Does writing code scare you? Want to witness some of the most horrifying 
code written? You know you want to. Our Hackerclub this week is all 
about Spooky Code and it’s taking place this Wednesday the 25th of 
October from 3-5pm in down in the depths of LG25. Join in on the 
Halloween celebrations and have some spooky pizza too!

Redbrick will be doing its annual pilgrimage to FOSDEM which is an 
open-source tech conference taking place in Brussels, Belgium on the 3rd 
and 4th of February 2024. You can register your interest by filling in 
this Google form [here](https://forms.gle/2ExGn2XwsjRcgKLm9). Deadline 
for registering your interest is the 3rd of November.

Do you want a Redbrick hoodie? Of course you do. It’s a great way to 
show off your Redbrick membership and you can have your username on the 
sleeve. If you are interested, please fill in this Google form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQ4DqXl4cd9g7VKC5lHzODlW3udn5wAPz…). 
Deadline for hoodie forms is the 27th of October *(THIS FRIDAY)*.

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2rCnJftcxn) server to interact with fellow brickies 
and the committee.

Have you ever seen code like [this](https://github.com/samuelmarina/is-even) and been completely 
traumatised by it? Want to see some janky code created by Redbrick 
committee members and even large companies? Get in the Halloween spirit 
and come down to LG25 on Wednesday the 25th of October from 3-5pm to get 
spooked, along with some pizza!
