Hey, brickies!

Welcome to week 9 everyone! Hope you all had a lovely weekend!

The days are getting shorter and Mariah Carey is defrosting. Christmas 
is right around the corner, but sadly we have exams to do first :(

It’s Movember and our discord server icon has been changed to a handsome 
fellow. Meet Mr. Gentlebrick who will be staying around with us until 
December.

We will be hosting a talk from a developer at 2K Games on Tuesday the 
7th of November from 4-5pm. This is perfect for any 3rd and 4th years 
currently on the job hunt. They will be going over how to get into the 
gaming industry and will be available for any questions you might have. 
There will be pizza and 2K merch available!

Our Hackerclub this week is all about shell scripting. Do you have 
specific tasks that you do on your computer regularly? Why not automate 
them with a shell script? Make your way to LG25 on Wednesday the 8th of 
November from 3-5pm to start scripting! Pizza will be served.

Redbrick, along with UCD, TUD and more are organising a Computing 
Societies Ball which will be taking place around mid-February 2024 (Date 
coming soon™) Tickets will be around €60 with more information coming in 
the following weeks. If you would be interested in attending, fill out 
this Google form [here](https://forms.gle/hPgANpJ4iKcWv2B19).

An email regarding Redbrick hoodie payments has been sent out, so check 
your inboxes folks! The payment deadline is Thursday the 9th of November 
at 11:59pm so make sure you have paid by then!

We also have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you all. You can get 
your very own Blueblock™ hoodie, it’s the same design and price as the 
Redbrick one but it’s blue, just that alone makes it worth getting! Even 
if you missed out on a regular Redbrick hoodie, you can still get a 
Blueblock one. Act now because once they’re gone, they’re gone!

If you would like to purchase a Blueblock hoodie (I know you do), please 
contact @distrobyte on Discord or email distro(a)redbrick.dcu.ie

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/redbrickdcu) server to interact with fellow brickies 
and the committee.

everything in your life? Or just want to troll your friends with some 
“funny” scripts? Shell out and come on down to LG25 on Wednesday the 8th 
of November from 3-5pm to learn all of the cool stuff you can do with 
Shell Scripts. free-pizza.sh will be executed!
