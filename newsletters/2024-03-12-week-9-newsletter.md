Hey, brickies!

Welcome to week 9! Hope you had a nice weekend. This cat is studying hard for our upcoming pub quiz, keep your calendars free as we have some awesome events coming up for you!

Let's get right into what's coming up over the next few weeks! Hackerclub this week is all about shell scripting and getting to grips with Linux commands. Our main event this week is an admin bootcamp, helping you to learn the ins and outs of being a sysadmin for Redbrick. In two weeks time we will have our annual pub quiz in Nubar, so get your thinking caps on and start preparing now!

Are you interested in shaping the future of Redbrick by running for next year's committee? Well now's your chance! Our AGM will be taking place in a few weeks time. All positions are up for grabs so if you are interested in running, make sure to come along! Positions such as SysAdmin, Helpdesk and Webmaster require a separate exam before you can run, details regarding the exams will be posted in the coming weeks.

During the AGM we will be ratifying our open governance documents, please read through them in advance of the AGM as you will be asked to vote them in on the day. You can find the documents [here](https://redbrick.dcu.ie/open-governance/readme.html).

If you haven't already, make sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.redbrick.dcu.ie/) server to interact with fellow brickies and the committee.
