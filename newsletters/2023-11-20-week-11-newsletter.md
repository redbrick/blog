Hey, brickies!

Welcome to week 11 everyone! Hope you all had a lovely weekend! You 
better start writing those Santa letters (preferably in Markdown) and 
get them sent off to the Redbrick Santa before the Christmas Party!

Did someone say Christmas Party? Looks like Mariah Carey has finally 
defrosted! Redbrick will be having its annual Christmas party featuring 
our very own Santa in Nubar on Tuesday the 28th of November from 7.30pm. 
And instead of pizza, presents will be given out!

Hackerclub this week will be all about the world of Cloud Computing. We 
will be walking you through how to host your website on your own domain, 
as well as telling you all about the great offers that are available to 
students. Get your head out of the clouds and come back down to LG25 on 
Wednesday the 22nd of November from 3-5pm. We will have cloud-flavoured 
pizza for you!

For our main event this week we will be hosting a Q&A talk with a 
developer from 2K games! Ever wanted to learn how your favourite games 
are made? Well, come on down to LG25 on Tuesday the 21st of November 
from 4-5pm. 2K have also opened their graduate program, if you are 
interested in applying for it, click this link [here](https://boards.greenhouse.io/2k/jobs/5720370003).

Redbrick, along with UCD, TUD and more are organising a Computing 
Societies Ball which will be taking place around mid-February 2024 (Date 
coming soon™) Tickets will be around €60 with more information coming in 
the following weeks. If you would be interested in attending, fill out
