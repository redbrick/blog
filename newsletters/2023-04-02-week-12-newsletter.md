![Week 12 Newsletter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/523562314344038411/1092149006064431244/school-work.gif)


Hey, brickies!
Hope you are doing well and are having a good weekend.

I can’t believe it’s week 12 already, this semester has flown by and 
I’ve been wondering where the time has gone. The exams are looming ever 
closer but we don’t talk about that.

Welcome to the first newsletter by your new secretary, Jake. Every 
secretary has had a certain theme for the emails. At the start of this 
college year it was F1 news, then it was bread, and now I present the 
new theme: cat gifs, because who doesn't like them? You will like them :)

Today’s cat GIF of the week is an accurate representation of me writing 
this newsletter for you. Speedy cat typing away, look at him go! He 
definitely has a record-breaking WPM score.

We held our AGM last week where many members showed up to vote and ran 
for positions. Thank you to everyone for attending, voting and running. 
Pizza was eaten, members were elected and resign was screamed.

Today was a sad day also, with many of our 4th years leaving us soon. 
Thank you for all your hard work over the years, you will be missed! 
Meet your new committee and view their roles below. Well done to the 
newmittie of 2023/24!
